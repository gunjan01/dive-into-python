Section 6.2: Working with File Objects

>>> f = open(...)
>>> f.tell()  # returns current position in the open file

but you knew that from the Python Tutorial section 7.2, didn't you?

Example 6.7 bullet 3: 'file' is a synonym for 'open'


Section 6.3: Iterating with for loops
- does this really belong in a chapter titled "Exceptions and File Handling"??


Section 6.4: Using sys.modules
- "sys.modules is a dictionary containing all the modules that have ever been imported since Python was started"
- get any class instance's module through its "__module__" attribute

Section 6.5: Working with Directories
- "os.listdir(directory)" returns a list of all the files and folders in "directory"
