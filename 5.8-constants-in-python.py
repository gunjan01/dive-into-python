Section 5.8: Introducing Class Attributes

This was actually just an aside/sidebar, but it was noteworthy enough that I want to dedicate a file to it.

"There are no constants in Python. Everything can be changed if you try hard enough. 
This fits with one of the core principles of Python: bad behavior should be discouraged but not banned. 
If you really want to change the value of None, you can do it, but don't come running to me when 
your code is impossible to debug."


Similarly...
Section 5.9: Private Functions
"Nothing in Python is truly private...
like many other things in Python, their privateness is ultimately a matter of convention, not force."
